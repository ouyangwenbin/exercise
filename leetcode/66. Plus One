Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer.

You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

class Solution(object):
    def plusOne(self, digits):

        nums = reduce(lambda x,y:x*10+y,digits)+1
        return [int(i) for i in str(nums)]
